# SoroTask Keeper Configuration Guide

Welcome to the SoroTask Keeper network! This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run a SoroTask Keeper bot. By running a keeper, you help ensure tasks in the SoroTask network are executed reliably and on time.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [npm](https://npmjs.com/) 

## Environment Variables

The keeper bot requires certain configuration details to interact with the Stellar/Soroban network. 
Create a `.env` file in the `keeper` directory and configure the following variables:

```env
# The URL of the Soroban RPC server you are connecting to
SOROBAN_RPC_URL="https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org"

# The network passphrase for the network you are targeting
NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022"

# The secret key of the keeper account that will submit the transactions
KEEPER_SECRET="S..."

# The contract ID of the deployed SoroTask contract
CONTRACT_ID="C..."

# Polling interval in milliseconds (default: 10000ms = 10 seconds)
POLLING_INTERVAL_MS=10000

# Maximum number of concurrent task reads during polling (default: 10)
MAX_CONCURRENT_READS=10

# Maximum number of concurrent task executions (default: 3)
MAX_CONCURRENT_EXECUTIONS=3

# Maximum task ID to check (default: 100) - or use TASK_IDS for specific tasks
MAX_TASK_ID=100

# Optional: Comma-separated list of specific task IDs to monitor
# TASK_IDS="1,2,3,5,8"

# Wait for transaction confirmation (default: true, set to 'false' to disable)
WAIT_FOR_CONFIRMATION=true
```

### Explanation of Variables:
- **`SOROBAN_RPC_URL`**: This is the endpoint the bot uses to communicate with the network. You can use public nodes provided by Stellar or set up your own. 
- **`NETWORK_PASSPHRASE`**: This ensures your bot is talking to the right network (e.g., Futurenet, Testnet, or Public Network).
- **`KEEPER_SECRET`**: Your keeper wallet's secret key. *Keep this private and never commit it to version control (we've ensured `.env` is ignored by git).*
- **`CONTRACT_ID`**: The deployed SoroTask contract address that the keeper will monitor and execute tasks from.
- **`POLLING_INTERVAL_MS`**: How often (in milliseconds) the keeper checks for due tasks. Lower values mean more frequent checks but higher RPC usage.
- **`MAX_CONCURRENT_READS`**: Maximum number of tasks to query in parallel during each poll. Higher values speed up polling but increase RPC load.
- **`MAX_CONCURRENT_EXECUTIONS`**: Maximum number of tasks that can be executed simultaneously. Controls execution throughput.
- **`MAX_TASK_ID`**: The keeper will check task IDs from 1 to this value. Alternatively, use `TASK_IDS` to specify exact task IDs.
- **`TASK_IDS`**: Optional comma-separated list of specific task IDs to monitor (e.g., "1,2,3,5"). If set, overrides `MAX_TASK_ID`.
- **`WAIT_FOR_CONFIRMATION`**: Whether to wait for transaction confirmation after submitting. Set to 'false' for fire-and-forget mode.

## Setup Instructions

Once you have your prerequisite software and environment variables ready, follow these steps on a clean environment:

1. **Navigate to the Keeper Directory**  
   Open your terminal and navigate to the `keeper` folder if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   cd keeper
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install the required Node.js packages (`soroban-client`, `dotenv`, and `node-fetch`):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Keeper Bot**  
   Start the Node.js application to begin listening for and executing SoroTask tasks:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

If successful, you will see output indicating that the Keeper has started, along with logs of its periodic checks for due tasks!

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Account not found"
- **Cause**: The account associated with your `KEEPER_SECRET` does not exist on the network you are trying to use.
- **Solution**: Fund your keeper account. If you are on Testnet or Futurenet, use the [Stellar Laboratory Friendbot](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator) to fund the public key associated with your secret. Ensure you've set the correct `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` and match the network on Stellar Laboratory.

### Issue: "RPC error" or "Could not connect to server"
- **Cause**: The bot cannot reach the specified RPC endpoint, or the endpoint rejected the request due to rate-limiting or an invalid URL setup.
- **Solution**: 
  - Double-check your `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` in the `.env` file for any typos. Ensure it includes the proper protocol (e.g., `https://`).
  - If you're using a public RPC, you might be rate-limited. Wait a few moments and try again, or switch to a dedicated/private RPC provider node.

### Issue: `Error: Cannot find module 'dotenv'` or `Error: Cannot find module 'soroban-client'`
- **Cause**: Application dependencies were not correctly or fully installed.
- **Solution**: Ensure you ran `npm install` inside the `keeper/` directory correctly. Try clearing cache or removing `node_modules` (`rm -rf node_modules`) and running `npm install` again.
